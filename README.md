# trading-tool
First python project built in August 2022. Code is not efficient since I was new in programming. There are a lot of codes need to optimize.
# Note
Due to FTX(was second big crypto exchange) collapsed on November 9th 2022. This software is no longer usable.
However, live market chart is still working(Binance account and VPN are required)
